## GestureVolumeControl

GestureVolumeControl is a hand-tracking application designed to adjust a device's volume using the movement of the user's thumb and index finger. This program is built with OpenCV (cv2) for hand tracking and uses Osascript to ensure compatibility with MacOS.

## Description

This Project is derived from Murtaza's Workshop Gesture Volume Control video. Originally using Pycaw, which is not compatible with MacOS, the Osascript additon makes this possible.
